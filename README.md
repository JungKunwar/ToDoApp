our daily life is to perform listing and scheduling of our upcoming activities/tasks. This
application provides an interface for mentioning our task and total list of mentioned tasks.
Moreover, it is dedicated for a single user so the application has authentication for that user
only. This capability of authentication increase the privacy on information about tasks to
be done by that user.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
## Objective:
The main objective of this product is to provide a listing of any activities/tasks in a proper
manner. This application enables to schedule activities/tasks by using calendar view.

## Purpose:

check box. Moreover, completed activities/tasks can also be deleted when there is no need
and there is also editing section in case of any mistake while inserting activities/tasks.

## Scope:
This product supports only the Android OS and accessible only after proper authentication.
The Architecture, Security and the proper listing environment itself are the scope of this
product. 

# SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOL
## Java:
Java is a simple and yet powerful object oriented programming language and it is in many
respects similar to C++. It was developed to provide a platform-independent programming
language. Java is a platform neutral language, which means it is not tied to any particular
hardware or operating system. It guarantees users to ‘write once, run anywhere’. Java
language is supported by almost every operating system such as Sun Solaris, RedHat,
Windows etc. Java has evolved from a simple language providing interactive dynamic
content for web pages to a predominant enterprise-enabled programming language suitable
for developing significant and critical applications.

## OOP:
Learn Object Oriented Concepts for Android: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a
programming language model that allows users to create and organize Java applications on
desktops. Writing object-oriented programs involves creating classes, objects and
applications which are stand-alone executable programs that use those objects. It simplifies
software development and maintenance by providing some concepts. A few aspects of
Object-Oriented development, it can help to make the best of our Android projects (Objects
and Classes, Inheritance, Interface, Encapsulation, Abstraction and Polymorphism).

## Android Studio:
Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android
application development. It is based on the IntelliJ IDEA, a Java integrated development
environment for software, and incorporates its code editing and developer tools.To support
application development within the Android operating system, Android Studio uses a
Gradle-based build system, emulator, code templates, and Github integration. Every
project in Android Studio has one or more modalities with source code and resource files.
These modalities include Android app modules, Library modules, and Google App Engine
modules.

## JDK:
A Java Development Kit or JDK is a widely used software development environment
package, which is used for any or all the softwares developed with Java as its platform. As
it gives a rarely advantageous combination of properties like security, consistency,
reliability and good processing speed, Java is chosen by most of the developers for creating
a system application or a web application. JDK is an essential part for creating a functional
environment for the Java development process.

# Project Implementation:
For authentication purpose there is a login form for a single user (this app is dedicated for
a single mobile user) and logout button is also available to end his/her session. By using
fragments there are two sections defined i.e. ADD and LIST. Also, User Interface (UI)
features included within this application are:
<li>“ADD” section is available to add a new activity/task with date with the help of calendar
view.</li>
<li>“SAVE TODO” button is available to save it.</li>
<li>“LIST” section is responsible to show all the added activities/tasks.</li>
<li>Edit and delete buttons are also available for editing tasks and deletion of completed task.</li>
<li>If the user also wish to store completed activities/tasks as well then he/she can use check
box instead of deleting it.</li>
<li>“LOGOUT” button is available.</li>
